                        │     ├ Title           : Incorrect cipher key and IV length processing 
                        │     ├ Description     : Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the
                        │     │                   processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.
                        │     │                   This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the
                        │     │                   initialisation of some symmetric ciphers. Impact summary: A
                        │     │                   truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which
                        │     │                   could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher
                        │     │                   modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(),
                        │     │                   EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided
                        │     │                   OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
                        │     │                   established. Any alterations to the key length, via the
                        │     │                   "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen"
                        │     │                   parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect
                        │     │                   as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of
                        │     │                    these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are
                        │     │                   impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM
                        │     │                   and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss
                        │     │                    of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP
                        │     │                   800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a
                        │     │                   deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the
                        │     │                   counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both truncations and
                        │     │                   overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce
                        │     │                   incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
                        │     │                   exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed
                        │     │                   as security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is
                        │     │                   not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable
                        │     │                   API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
                        │     │                   application developers will have spotted this problem during
                        │     │                   testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the
                        │     │                   communication were similarly vulnerable. For these reasons we
                        │     │                    expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to
                        │     │                    this to be quite low. However if an application is
                        │     │                   vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For
                        │     │                   these reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate
                        │     │                   severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not
                        │     │                   affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS
                        │     │                   providers are not affected by this because the issue lies
                        │     │                   outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0
                        │     │                   are vulnerable to this issue.A flaw was found in OpenSSL in

                        │     │                   This issue can lead to potential truncation or overruns

                              ├ Title           : Incorrect cipher key and IV length processing 
                              ├ Description     : Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the
                              │                   processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.
                              │                   This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the
                              │                   initialisation of some symmetric ciphers. Impact summary: A
                              │                   truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which
                              │                   could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher
                              │                   modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(),
                              │                   EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided
                              │                   OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
                              │                   established. Any alterations to the key length, via the
                              │                   "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen"
                              │                   parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect
                              │                   as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of
                              │                    these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are
                              │                   impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM
                              │                   and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss
                              │                    of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP
                              │                   800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a
                              │                   deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the
                              │                   counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both truncations and
                              │                   overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce
                              │                   incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
                              │                   exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed
                              │                   as security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is
                              │                   not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable
                              │                   API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
                              │                   application developers will have spotted this problem during
                              │                   testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the
                              │                   communication were similarly vulnerable. For these reasons we
                              │                    expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to
                              │                    this to be quite low. However if an application is
                              │                   vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For
                              │                   these reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate
                              │                   severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not
                              │                   affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS
                              │                   providers are not affected by this because the issue lies
                              │                   outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0
                              │                   are vulnerable to this issue.A flaw was found in OpenSSL in
                              │                   how it processes key and initialization vector (IV) lengths.
                              │                   This issue can lead to potential truncation or overruns
                              │                   during the initialization of some symmetric ciphers. A
                              │                   truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which
                              │                   could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher
                              │                   modes. Both truncations and overruns of the key and the IV
                              │                   will produce incorrect results and could, in some cases,
                              │                   trigger a memory exception.
