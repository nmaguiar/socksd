    Title: 'openssl: Excessive time spent checking DSA keys and parameters'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
      slow.

      Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
      or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
      experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
      have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
      Service.

      The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
      various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
      if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

      Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
      public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
      verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
      the modulus size when performing the checks.

      An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
      and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
      vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

      These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
      only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

      Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
      when using the `-check` option.

      The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

      The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

    Title: 'openssl: SSL_select_next_proto buffer overread'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
      empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
      be sent to the peer.

      Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
      such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
      could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
      to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
      that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
      supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
      be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
      accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
      application.

      The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
      applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
      (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
      is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
      widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
      protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
      the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
      client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
      first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
      between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
      called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
      returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
      that there was no overlap in the lists).

      This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
      ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
      of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
      length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
      normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
      SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
      supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
      application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
      accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
      accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
      parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a "no overlap"
      response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
      will be vulnerable to this problem.

      In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
      a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
      in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
      from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
      However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
      client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
      application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
      confidentiality will occur.

      This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
      likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
      widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
      Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
      exploitation unlikely.

      The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

      Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
      OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
      become available.

    Title: 'openssl: Excessive time spent checking DSA keys and parameters'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
      slow.

      Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
      or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
      experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
      have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
      Service.

      The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
      various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
      if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

      Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
      public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
      verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
      the modulus size when performing the checks.

      An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
      and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
      vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

      These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
      only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

      Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
      when using the `-check` option.

      The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

      The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

    Title: 'openssl: SSL_select_next_proto buffer overread'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
      empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
      be sent to the peer.

      Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
      such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
      could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
      to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
      that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
      supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
      be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
      accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
      application.

      The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
      applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
      (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
      is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
      widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
      protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
      the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
      client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
      first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
      between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
      called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
      returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
      that there was no overlap in the lists).

      This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
      ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
      of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
      length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
      normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
      SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
      supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
      application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
      accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
      accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
      parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a "no overlap"
      response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
      will be vulnerable to this problem.

      In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
      a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
      in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
      from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
      However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
      client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
      application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
      confidentiality will occur.

      This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
      likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
      widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
      Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
      exploitation unlikely.

      The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

      Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
      OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
      become available.
