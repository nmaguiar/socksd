    Title: 'openssl: denial of service via null dereference'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
      to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

      Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
      sources might terminate abruptly.

      A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
      untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
      OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
      dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
      files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
      be vulnerable to this issue.

      OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
      PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
      and PKCS12_newpass().

      We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
      function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

      The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
